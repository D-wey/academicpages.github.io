Course Description
======
This course introduces undergraduate students to quantitative methods used for research in the
field of international relations and European integration. The goal is to equip students with the
skills necessary to write a successful BA thesis and to train them to do so using the statistical
package STATA. The course emphasizes data management, descriptive statistics, data visualization,
 techniques for dealing with continuous, binary and count dependent variables, time-series
cross-sectional data as well as regression diagnostics. A good working knowledge of statistics is a
prerequisite for successful participation in the class.


Course Objectives
======
Based on the course contents, students will be able to identify the correct statistical model for
different types of data and research questions and to justify their decision. They are able to correctly
specify such a model as well as test the modelâ€™s assumptions and implement this in STATA. Lastly,
students are able to describe and visualize the results as well as evaluate and interpret them in
light of the research question and transfer the acquired skills to their own research interests after
this course.
