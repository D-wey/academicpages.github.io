I teach undergraduate classes for 3rd to 5th semester students. I focus on empirical research on international cooperation. For a broad overview of my teaching concept see: [Teaching Concept](http://d-wey.github.io/files/teaching_concept.pdf), more detailled information on the classes I have taught can be found at:
