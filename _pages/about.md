I am a second year Ph.D Candidate at the Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS) and the Universtiy of Mannheim. My research interests are very broadly in international and transnatioanl cooperation. I teach quantitive methods and IR for undergrad students. 

Teaching
======

I teach undergraduate classes at the University of Mannheim. I focus on empirical research on international cooperation. For a broad overview of my teaching concept see: [Teaching Concept](http://d-wey.github.io/files/teaching_concept.pdf), more detailled information on the classes I have taught can be found at: [Teaching](https://d-wey.github.io/teaching/).

Research
======

My research interests lie in the determinants of inter- and transnational cooperation. My focus has been on the influence of governmental preferences in cooperative strategies, both in trasnnational governance (for example the IETF) or international cooperation in varying contexts. For more informaiton on the scope of my research see: [Publications](https://d-wey.github.io/publications/) or [Talks](https://d-wey.github.io/talks/).
